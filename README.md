# Terraria Aberration
This world shouldn't exist.

## An unsafe world
If you told the guide this place has seen better days, he would laugh.

## An underground nightmare
"I want to leave this place. How did I get here?" -Dryad

## An untamed adventure
Many have walked the path you have always took. Many have failed taking that path here.

## Aberration.
"You certainly get us into sticky situations." -Merchant
